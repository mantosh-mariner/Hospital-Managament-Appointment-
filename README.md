- **Doctor Management**: Doctors' details, including specialties and availability, are managed in the system.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can view doctors' available time slots and book appointments.
- **Email Notifications**: Confirmation emails are sent to patients upon successful booking.
- **Admin Panel**: For managing doctors, patients, and appointments.
